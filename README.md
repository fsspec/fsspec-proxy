Demo: pyscript+fsspec with proxy
================================

Quickstart
----------

In an environment with `fastapi` and `s3fs`, run:
```bash
$ ./run.sh
```
to start the proxy server, with port 8000.

The default config in `config.yaml` in this directory has entry "Conda Stats", 
which is available anonymously from S3.
